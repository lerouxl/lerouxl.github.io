      <!-- ABSTRACT -->
      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">Abstract</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The production of complex 3D components using Metal Additive Manufacturing requires several steps combining different expertise, such as product design, process planning and manufacturing. This process chain would benefit significantly from faster deformation predictions enabling quicker iteration during parts design and manufacture, such as to evaluate or validate quickly a component expected final shape, internal stresses or deformation occurring during printing. This paper presents a new data-driven approach based on deep learning that can speed up the prediction of parts' geometrical deformations by creating a digital twin of an FEA simulation. A new CNN model founded on MeshCNN and designed for the processing of AM 3D models is described and methods for testing learning capabilities using training data generated by the FEA based software Simufact Additive are proposed.</div>

      <!-- RESEARCH OVERVIEW -->
      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">Research Overview</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">In this paper, we developed <strong>AMMeshCNN</strong> (Additive Manufacturing MeshCNN), a specialized neural network based on MeshCNN architecture specifically designed to predict geometric deformations in metal additive manufacturing processes. The traditional approach to deformation prediction relies on finite element analysis (FEA) simulations, which, while accurate, are computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating a significant bottleneck in the design and manufacturing workflow.</div>
          
          <div class="body-text">Our approach addresses the fundamental challenge that metal AM processes, particularly Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), are subject to numerous defects including porosity, cracks, delamination, and geometric deformations caused by thermal stresses during the layer-by-layer manufacturing process. These deformations can lead to part failures or, in extreme cases, collisions between the printed part and the recoating system, potentially damaging both the part and the machine.</div>

            <div class="body-text" style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> MeshCNN edge features including dihedral angles (α2), inner angles (α0, α1), and edge-length ratios (r0, r1) that form the foundation for our AMMeshCNN modifications</div>
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">We enhanced the original MeshCNN architecture by adding several key features specifically tailored for additive manufacturing applications. First, we made the network sensitive to part orientation by incorporating angle invariance features, calculating the angle between each edge and the Z-axis to account for how part orientation affects laser path and cooling dynamics. Second, we addressed scale sensitivity by adding height position features for each edge, enabling the network to understand how part size influences thermal inertia and resulting deformations.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Additionally, we expanded the network architecture by adding more neural network layers, including a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) at the end of the decoder, to enhance the model's ability to learn complex physical relationships. The modified network processes edge features rather than vertex features, requiring us to develop a method to transfer edge predictions back to vertices for loss computation and visualization purposes.</div>

            <img src="../assets/images/Developing Rapid Metal AM deformations Prediction using CNN Figure 5.png" alt="Deep Learning Approach" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <div class="body-text" style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;"><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Deep learning approach for creating a digital twin of FEA simulations, enabling rapid deformation prediction with fixed process parameters</div>
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">The goal was to create a deep learning-based digital twin of finite element analysis simulations that could provide rapid deformation predictions with a fixed set of manufacturing parameters. By training on simulation data generated by Simufact Additive software, our model learns the statistical behavior of deformation patterns without requiring complex physical equations, dramatically reducing computational time while maintaining prediction accuracy.</div>

          <div class="body-text">For validation, we trained AMMeshCNN using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss with a learning rate of 0.001 for 50 epochs, followed by 40 epochs with learning rate decay. We initially tested the approach on simple geometric shapes, including randomly generated cubes with deformations created through inherent strain methods. The results demonstrated that the network effectively learned the deformation functions, with predicted vertices closely matching the ground truth labels.</div>

            <img src="../assets/images/Developing Rapid Metal AM deformations Prediction using CNN Figure 9.png" alt="AMMeshCNN Architecture" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd;">

          </div>

          <div class="body-text">The final AMMeshCNN architecture incorporates all these modifications into a cohesive system capable of processing 3D mesh data and predicting continuous deformation values. The network maintains the geometric advantages of MeshCNN's pooling operations, which respect part geometry by merging linked vertices, while adding the AM-specific enhancements necessary for accurate deformation prediction in manufacturing contexts.</div>

      <!-- RESULTS AND IMPACT -->
      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">Results and Future Work</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The preliminary results on simple geometric shapes demonstrated that AMMeshCNN successfully learned deformation patterns, with visual comparisons showing close agreement between predicted and actual deformation magnitudes. The color-coded visualization of cubes and predicted vertices revealed that the differences between labels and predictions were minimal, indicating effective learning of the underlying physical functions.</div>

            <img src="../assets/images/Developing Rapid Metal AM deformations Prediction using CNN Figure 10.png" alt="Cube Prediction Results" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <div class="body-text" style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;"><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Cube prediction results showing the actual cube (labeled data) and predicted vertices (spheres) colored by deformation magnitude. The close visual agreement demonstrates the network's effective learning of deformation functions.</div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="body-text">This research establishes a foundation for dramatically accelerating deformation prediction in metal additive manufacturing, enabling rapid design iteration, real-time process monitoring, and predictive quality control. The approach provides significant computational savings compared to traditional FEA methods while maintaining the accuracy needed for industrial applications. Future work will focus on comprehensive testing with more complex, real-world geometries from datasets like Thingi10k to fully validate the method's capabilities across diverse manufacturing scenarios.</div>
          
          <div class="body-text">The development of AMMeshCNN represents a significant step toward integrating artificial intelligence into manufacturing process control, offering the potential for real-time monitoring systems that can predict and prevent deformation-related failures before they occur, ultimately improving both efficiency and quality in metal additive manufacturing operations.</div>
