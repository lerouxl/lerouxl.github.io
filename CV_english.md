## Career Objective
PhD-level AI Scientist with 5+ years of experience at the intersection of industrial research and applied deep learning. Passionate about operationalizing cutting-edge AI (generative models, surrogate modeling, simulation optimization) and building scalable, robust systems. Versatile in both research and product settings, I aim to bring scientific rigor and practical engineering to Mistral AI's mission to democratize state-of-the-art models.

## Key Skills
- **AI & Deep Learning:** Surrogate modeling for physical simulations (CFD, mechanical), CNN (96% defect detection), GNNs, LLM fine-tuning (Mistral, Stable Diffusion), prompt engineering
- **Generative AI:** Hybrid RAG architectures, LLM fine-tuning, speech-to-speech chatbots
- **MLOps:** Weights & Biases, Docker, CI/CD, AWS Lambda, Logfire (real-time monitoring)
- **Software Engineering:** Advanced Python (including Django), cloud (AWS, Scaleway), Docker containers
- **Collaboration & Communication:** Academic & industrial research (EU H2020), mentoring, client presentations
